# Numerica
The Game of Numerica, a gem from Parker Brothers, is over 130 years old. A solitaire-based strategy game, players use color-coded counters to maximize scores on stacks and columns. Once popular, it's sadly been forgotten with time, but its nostalgic charm and intriguing gameplay beckon for a revival.
